War-torn England is reeling after years of bitter conflict. King Edward is ailing, and as political unrest begins to stir once more, Edward’s brother Richard – vicious in war, despised in peacetime – awaits the opportunity to seize his brother’s crown.

Olivier-winning director Rupert Goold’s (Macbeth, King Charles III) searing new production hones a microscopic focus on the mythology surrounding a monarch whose machinations are inextricably woven into the fabric of British history.",poster_path:"\u002FmDBXxXojpckSNFN5N7pp8KjlGZg.jpg",release_date:"2016-07-21",title:bm,video:R,vote_average:S,vote_count:h,popularity:2.813,character:"Richard III",credit_id:"579c9395c3a3681678006efc",order:g,media_type:c},{adult:a,backdrop_path:f,genre_ids:[i,d,p],id:521335,original_language:b,original_title:bn,overview:"In the riotous, vibrant cities of 18th Century Land and Dublin, the drink-sodden and cantankerous composer, George Frideric Handel, is a forgotten man to all but his faithful, whip-smart valet Peter.
