She was replaced by Annie Potts as Dana Palladino, who bought Porter's restaurant and also became a love interest for Jack.\n\nThe first season also featured moments when Jack or Wally would break the fourth wall and address the camera directly, generally using it as an opportunity to discuss an emotional crisis. This mechanic was dropped in later seasons.\n\nOne episode featured a guest appearance from Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David as themselves, they did this as a \"thank you\" to creator Diane English for allowing a brief scene on Murphy Brown in an episode of Seinfeld where Kramer is cast as the titular character's secretary.\n\nThe show's supporting cast included Suzie Plakson, Joanna Gleason, Joel Murray, Charles Robinson and Michael Nouri. John Hancock, who had a recurring role as a judge on L.A. Law with Susan Dey previously, portrayed bartender Ike for the first half of season one, until he died of a heart attack in late 1992. His death was subsequently written into the series and he was replaced by actor Charlie Robinson.",poster_path:"\u002Fn7DJOdcjE2CRvmSQgNg0nUJlDdo.jpg",vote_average:p,vote_count:k,popularity:7.956,character:h,credit_id:"525795de760ee36aaa71e89c",episode_count:k,media_type:f},{original_name:an,id:45301,name:an,vote_count:k,vote_average:6.5,first_air_date:"2012-03-23",poster_path:"\u002Fol6ZMFexFpHIn6BopZLuJRfJZg0.jpg",genre_ids:[Q,10764],original_language:b,backdrop_path:"\u002F6oxGr4x6F5T08RJoWfvtphYd0Ou.jpg",overview:"A reality-tv show where 5 celebrity couples in rocky relationships each season would stay in a big mansion together with continous meetings with psychologists and experts in the field led by Dr. Jenn Mann to try to sort their relationship problems as well as personal ones.\n\nThe 2 couples that spawned the most controversy in media were the tumultious relationship beween rapper DMX and Tashera Simmons plus actor Doug Hutchinson (The Green Mile) and wife and fame-seeker Courtney Stodden  (they stood out alot due to Courtney being 17 turning 18 when the show was filmed while Doug was 52).\n\nSome a-list celebs appeared (Too Short,  Treach from Naughty By Nature, Jenna Jameson, Scott Stapp from Creed, JoJo from K-Ci and JoJo and Ghostface Killah for instance).",origin_country:[e],popularity:1.003,character:"Himself",credit_id:"5ade1472c3a36876fe00116a",episode_count:10,media_type:f}],crew:[]},external_ids:{freebase_mid:"\u002Fm\u002F0b10t7",freebase_id:"\u002Fen\u002Fdoug_hutchison",imdb_id:x,tvrage_id:27851,facebook_id:i,instagram_id:i,twitter_id:i}}}],fetch:[],mutations:[]}}(false,"en",18,"movie","US","tv",80,"",null,9648,2,1,0,28,53,3,7,4,7.7,10759,5.9,6.7,35,"nm0006535","\u002F4gbYejYsMxNGZO0sZjO2gwUcjLl.jpg",5.7,"The Burrowers","Hope For The Holidays","No Good Deed","The Chocolate War","1988-11-18","Give 'em Hell, Malone","Bait","The Salton Sea","Punisher: War Zone","Moola",6,"The Green Mile",14,"Fresh Horses",12,"Walking the Mile: The Making of The Green Mile",99,"I Am Sam",7.5,"A Time to Kill","Con Air","Batman & Robin","Shaft","John Doe",7.6,"Kidnapped","The Practice",10765,"The X-Files","Millennium","Lost","Lie to Me","Murder, She Wrote","Boomtown","CSI: Crime Scene Investigation","CSI: Miami","24","Law & Order: Special Victims Unit","Space: Above and Beyond","Party of Five","Love & War","Couples Therapy")));
