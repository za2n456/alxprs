This version, although it retained the name Make Way for Noddy, was a longer format; it combined two of the 12-minute segments with new material. Along with the story episodes featuring Noddy and his friends, the PBS format included two interstitials, a music video and footage of British television presenter Naomi Wilkinson from Milkshake! The Say it With Noddy interstitials featured Noddy learning various foreign-language words from a robot named Whizz. Although most of the Noddy characters had been re-dubbed to remove their British accents, Naomi spoke with a strong British accent and used British English words and phrases in conversation.
