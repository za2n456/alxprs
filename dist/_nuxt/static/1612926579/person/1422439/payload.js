There, he has become notorious for his lofty and outdated theories on love and romance. When Amber Hewson, a free-spirited young woman with a restless soul, drifts into the area and rents the apartment above his shop, she finds herself surprisingly drawn to his noble ideas, which are new and intriguing to her. And Clay, though he tries to fight and deny it, simply cannot resist being attracted to her spontaneous and passionate embrace of life. Ultimately, Clay must step out from behind his relational theories, and Amber must overcome her own fears and deep wounds, as the two of them, together, attempt the impossible: an “old-fashioned” courtship in contemporary America.",poster_path:"\u002F8kwfUSdpg31yckaH6yFiHyo7v1Z.jpg",popularity:10.772,character:f,credit_id:"54d0be049251417c0b002eb1",order:5,media_type:e},{overview:"When four generations of the Cooper clan come together for their annual Christmas Eve celebration, a series of unexpected visitors and unlikely events turn the night upside down, leading them all toward a surprising rediscovery of family bonds and the spirit of the holiday.",release_date:"2015-11-12",adult:a,backdrop_path:"\u002FAgtqNrhuRr7YjNqwmglnyVfvxil.jpg",id:333348,genre_ids:[l,10751,c],vote_count:579,original_language:d,original_title:m,poster_path:"\u002FfPW1BHZhUEViOmDAHFfyLezoQdI.jpg",video:a,title:m,vote_average:6,popularity:13.848,character:"Mrs. Pinkins",credit_id:"5a1e5c400e0a264cbc07898a",order:c,media_type:e},{genre_ids:[c],original_language:d,original_title:n,poster_path:"\u002FziVOzoGfmHD5F90LyeCkBnwuTkP.jpg",video:a,vote_average:6.2,overview:"A salesman for a natural gas company experiences life-changing events after arriving in a small town, where his corporation wants to tap into the available resources.",id:133694,vote_count:484,title:n,adult:a,backdrop_path:"\u002FtGoiwOOqoHhxq4mfNx18woIchug.jpg",release_date:"2012-09-23",popularity:15.235,character:"Arlene",credit_id:"5b75d21a0e0a264ef5005cbb",order:19,media_type:e},{adult:a,backdrop_path:"\u002FrsBFDOVtsVQ76dcOsRMTmREFffV.jpg",genre_ids:[c,l,k],id:43347,original_language:d,original_title:"Love & Other Drugs",overview:"Maggie is an alluring free spirit who won't let anyone - or anything - tie her down.
