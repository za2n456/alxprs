The protagonists were Michael Murray, the Militant tendency-supporting Labour leader of a city council in the North of England and Jim Nelson, the headmaster of a school for disturbed children.\n\nThe series was controversial partly because Murray appeared to be based on Derek Hatton, former Deputy Leader of Liverpool City Council — in an interview in the G.B.H. DVD Bleasdale recounts an accidental meeting with Hatton before the series, who indicates that he has caught wind of Bleasdale's intentions but does not mind as long as the actor playing him is \"handsome\".\n\nIn normal parlance, the initials \"GBH\" refer to the criminal charge of grievous bodily harm - however, the actual intent of the letters is that it is supposed to stand for Great British Holiday.",origin_country:[j],popularity:4.474,character:"Dr Jacobs",credit_id:"575e9cd99251413340000d88",episode_count:n,media_type:i},{original_name:bm,id:4205,name:bm,vote_count:v,vote_average:r,first_air_date:"1995-01-03",poster_path:"\u002FqIXHr4lgRmlBOlBTj1aJdHPPE8r.jpg",genre_ids:[F,e],original_language:b,backdrop_path:c,overview:"Kavanagh QC is a British television series made by Central Television for ITV between 1995 and 2001. It is often repeated on ITV3, and series 1–6 are available on Region 2 DVDs.\n\nThe series starred John Thaw as barrister James Kavanagh QC who comes from a working-class upbringing in Bolton, Greater Manchester. This is only discovered in later episodes as his parents' health deteriorates and through an exchange with a colleague who presumed that Kavanagh was actually a Yorkshireman. The series dealt with his battles in the courtroom as well as his domestic dramas which include the death of his devoted and affectionate wife. Later he begins dating a fellow barrister.\n\nIn court Kavanagh is usually seen to be defending a client who seems likely to be convicted until a twist in the case occurs, but occasionally Kavanagh is seen in a prosecuting role. The main plot often features Kavanagh confronting cases with a subtext of racism, sexism or other prejudice. In sub-plots comedy came from the pomposity and self-absorption of Jeremy, a posh barrister in chambers. Kavanagh will not stand for injustice and is never bullied by threats or bribes from those whom he is up against in the courtroom.",origin_country:[j],popularity:4.58,character:l,credit_id:"584fde84c3a3683123007480",episode_count:g,media_type:i},{backdrop_path:"\u002F3SiQfvz3Frn2OTlXnzGFqkA52By.jpg",first_air_date:"2002-04-08",genre_ids:[F,e],id:1167,name:bn,origin_country:[j],original_language:b,original_name:bn,overview:"DS Barbara Havers is assigned to work with the upper-crust DI Thomas Lynley to solve murders.",poster_path:"\u002F3ZMh9mGQLioDXlKFwGYXxrWklke.jpg",vote_average:I,vote_count:R,popularity:13.547,character:"Sergent Mike McCaffrey",credit_id:"59901289c3a3687442027487",episode_count:g,media_type:i},{backdrop_path:c,first_air_date:"1990-10-08",genre_ids:[],id:74196,name:bo,origin_country:[j],original_language:b,original_name:bo,overview:"A young man is reunited with his father, who has been presumed dead for ten years, and then tries to unravel the truth behind his disappearance.",poster_path:c,vote_average:h,vote_count:g,popularity:.87,character:"Claud Wareing",credit_id:"5a9596a992514156390017da",episode_count:o,media_type:i},{backdrop_path:"\u002FxIgtpD9VocEQMKmBobkwBqeGRTP.jpg",genre_ids:[J,x,S],original_name:bp,origin_country:["US"],poster_path:"\u002Fc9VxE3gMhq5lCYVpqvwBXb4UUzF.jpg",vote_count:157,id:40546,vote_average:I,overview:"Virginia and Tony, a father and daughter living in Manhattan, find themselves in a parallel universe where Snow White, Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood are struggling to maintain order.
