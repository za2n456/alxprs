Comprised of several short films by some of the world's most exciting directors, Words with Gods follows the theme of religion - specifically as it relates to an individual's relationship with his\u002Fher god or gods...or the lack thereof.  In Words with Gods, each director recounts a narrative centered around human fragility, as well as environmental and cultural crises involving specific religions with which each has a personal relationship; including early Aboriginal Spirituality, Umbanda, Buddhism, the Abrahamic faiths, Hinduism, and Atheism. An animated sequence by Mexican animator Maribel Martinez is woven through each of the film segments, with each segment narratively connected as a feature-length film.",poster_path:"\u002FhlVeqMN4wbP8r8WbM4UcAvMjKpj.jpg",release_date:"2014-11-20",title:bb,video:a,vote_average:6.2,vote_count:j,popularity:4.812,character:"Son (ep. \"God's Blood - La sangre de Dios\")",credit_id:"53f46ddb0e0a26419b0007e4",order:bc,media_type:b},{backdrop_path:"\u002F8PtOfFfX3anE4T63NjnfULRalMq.jpg",genre_ids:[e,k,q],original_language:c,poster_path:"\u002FgKUsBTa5b0GY7U4iWBseeBalfjO.jpg",vote_count:475,first_air_date:"2005-08-07",vote_average:R,name:bd,origin_country:[S],overview:"After the unexpected death of her husband, a suburban mom resorts to selling weed to support her family.",original_name:bd,id:186,popularity:45.248,character:"Esteban Carlos Reyes",credit_id:"5253449d19c29579400b93fb",episode_count:30,media_type:D},{original_name:be,origin_country:[S],genre_ids:[e],original_language:c,poster_path:"\u002FbjjhRrQrgbwAMEapwSiu6IobkKT.jpg",vote_count:93,vote_average:A,name:be,overview:"A murdered body on a bridge between El Paso and Juarez bring together El Paso detective Sonya Cross and Chihuahua State Police detective Marco Ruiz.",id:47141,backdrop_path:"\u002Fq79B4712oB6XWmDeFBj0xhadO7s.jpg",first_air_date:"2013-07-10",popularity:16.954,character:"Marco Ruiz",credit_id:"5273efc919c2953635033287",episode_count:26,media_type:D},{backdrop_path:"\u002F3m5nbGYXQqXxpqkFR5wlpLIGgqF.jpg",first_air_date:"2019-06-17",genre_ids:[e],id:82092,name:bf,origin_country:[S],original_language:c,original_name:bf,overview:"Santiago Mendoza owns last family-owned hotel in multicultural Miami Beach, while his glamorous second wife, Gigi, and their adult children enjoy the spoils of success.",poster_path:"\u002Fy0I9HeIEkNEOYPwCzhTrA6ZMXsQ.jpg",vote_average:R,vote_count:120,popularity:17.023,character:"Santiago Mendoza",credit_id:"5b8e266bc3a36852060611f4",episode_count:bc,media_type:D},{backdrop_path:"\u002F1TLd0AW4lqXrMS5zrcNYGIgjnb6.jpg",first_air_date:"2002-09-04",genre_ids:[],id:101602,name:bg,origin_country:["MX"],original_language:h,original_name:bg,overview:m,poster_path:"\u002Fu7D7nHeVE8OkQqgWwepaPdWOho2.jpg",vote_average:g,vote_count:g,popularity:4.99,character:aE,credit_id:"5e8d19a8ce997a0013b83751",episode_count:f,media_type:D}],crew:[{adult:a,backdrop_path:d,genre_ids:[o,e],id:K,original_language:c,original_title:L,overview:M,poster_path:N,release_date:O,title:P,video:a,vote_average:n,vote_count:f,popularity:t,credit_id:"53718a0b0e0a2672ee000bb4",department:"Directing",job:"Director",media_type:b},{adult:a,backdrop_path:d,genre_ids:[o,e],id:K,original_language:c,original_title:L,overview:M,poster_path:N,release_date:O,title:P,video:a,vote_average:n,vote_count:f,popularity:t,credit_id:"53718a190e0a2672e8000bcc",department:"Writing",job:"Screenplay",media_type:b}]},external_ids:{freebase_mid:"\u002Fm\u002F077t3p",freebase_id:"\u002Fen\u002Fdemian_bichir",imdb_id:T,tvrage_id:d,facebook_id:bh,instagram_id:bh,twitter_id:"demianbichir"}}}],fetch:[],mutations:[]}}(false,"movie","en",null,18,1,0,"es",2,3,35,53,"",5,10749,4,80,878,5.5,.6,6,8,28,36,7,9648,6.6,27,5.8,"tv",6.7,12,5.7,11,"Miguel",6.8,269579,"Un cuento de circo & a love song","A boy who grew up at the circus decides to leave his old life and go after the love of his life.","\u002FxXhbxTbNenb4G91b3mvTVMfeq4O.jpg","2016-01-01","A circus tale & a love song",99,7.3,"US","nm0065007","\u002Fsw8TqPQLbMMgLbkNNUIW649THWJ.jpg",5.246,52,"Todo el poder","Fuera Del Cielo",5.3,"The Runway","Hidalgo: la historia jamás contada",1.96,7.1,"A Better Life","American Visa",5.9,"Lowriders","7:19","The Nun",10752,"Che: Part One","Fidel Castro","Santitos","Hipnos","Dom Hemingway","Hasta Morir","Ave María","Walden: Life in The Woods",.84,"43","Armando","Machete Kills","The Heat","The Grudge","Corazón","Land","Salón México","Che: Part Two",7.4,"Miroslava","Mosquita muerta","Himself",19,"In the Time of the Butterflies",10770,"Foreverland","Chaos Walking","Luces de la noche","Solo","The Hateful Eight","Alien: Covenant","Alien: Covenant - Prologue: Phobos","Sergeant Carl Lope","Alien: Covenant - Prologue: Crew Messages","Heartbreak Hospital","Letters to Jackie: Remembering President Kennedy","Alien: Covenant - Prologue: Last Supper","The Midnight Sky","Enemigos íntimos","Astucia","Savages",6.4,"Viaje al paraíso","Good Kids","Godzilla vs. Kong","Choices of the Heart","Words with Gods",13,"Weeds","The Bridge","Grand Hotel","Las Lunas del Auditorio","demianbichiroficial")));
