Its original name had to be changed for copyright reasons.\n\nThe series recounts the experiences of a middle-class family, the Alcántaras, during the last years of the rule of Francisco Franco and the beginning of the Spanish Transition to democracy. Its name comes from a famous song by the Spanish 1960s pop group Fórmula V, titled Tell Me. The producer of the series is Miguel Ángel Bernardeau.\n\nThe series was created to celebrate the first 25 years since Spain's transition to democracy, and its didactic spirit is clearly evident in some of the episodes. It includes documentary interviews with historical figures of the era, such as people concerned with the assassination of then prime minister Carrero Blanco and the death of Franco.\n\nThe first episode was broadcast on September 13, 2001. The series begins in April 1968 with the victory in the Eurovision song contest of the singer Massiel. The story reflects changes in Spain beginning in that year.\n\nIn December 2008, TVE and Ganga Group announced that the series, in its 10th season, had achieved very good audience levels, and would be renewed for up to 3 more seasons, with the storyline moving firmly into the 1980s and the \"Movida madrileña\".",poster_path:"\u002FjjFZj2x6cVVs0WrMG69pBhWP8rE.jpg",vote_average:5.8,vote_count:25,popularity:9.134,character:"Toño",credit_id:"5e84beae691cd50014579982",episode_count:q,media_type:e},{backdrop_path:"\u002FuLap7xwWfXvrviuPw0HBNpdMSE3.jpg",first_air_date:"2012-09-10",genre_ids:[d],id:42276,name:R,origin_country:[g],original_language:a,original_name:R,overview:"Charting the life of Isabella I of Castile, one of the most important women in Spain’s history, Isabel follows her passionate story from childhood to being crowned Queen.
