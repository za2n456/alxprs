With this unprecedented access, Emmy-winning, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Robert B. Weide followed the notoriously private film legend over a year and a half to create the ultimate film biography. \"Woody Allen: A Documentary\" chronicles Allen's career - from teen writer to Sid Caesar's TV scribe, from stand-up comedian to award-winning writer-director averaging one film-per-year for more than 40 years. Exploring Allen's writing habits, casting, directing, and relationship with his actors first-hand, new interviews with A-listers, writing partners, family and friends provide insight and backstory to the usually inscrutable filmmaker.",poster_path:"\u002Fs7IA3Ng2mLer8lt8j1BhsVulLqQ.jpg",release_date:"2011-11-20",title:bT,video:a,vote_average:aZ,vote_count:121,popularity:15.28,character:p,credit_id:"52fe47fc9251416c9107c47b",order:I,media_type:c},{id:353746,video:a,vote_count:R,vote_average:R,title:bU,release_date:"2014-08-26",original_language:b,original_title:bU,genre_ids:[t],backdrop_path:h,adult:a,overview:"The grim woes that surrounded famed director Peter Bogdanovich and his film, \"They All Laughed.\"",poster_path:"\u002Fe6BNOauEKktKTrb2xMKSiIdY7zZ.jpg",popularity:4.846,character:p,credit_id:"5acec54d9251410c39030031",order:I,media_type:c},{id:655064,video:true,vote_count:e,vote_average:v,title:bV,release_date:"2008-01-01",original_language:b,original_title:bV,genre_ids:[],backdrop_path:h,adult:a,overview:"Interviews with individuals involved in the making of Wes Anderson's 1996 film \"Bottle Rocket.\"",poster_path:h,popularity:.68,character:ag,credit_id:"5e811178498ef90017c93419",order:10,media_type:c},{adult:a,backdrop_path:h,genre_ids:[t],id:199353,original_language:b,original_title:bW,overview:"Documentary created by Matthew Gray Gubler during, and about, his time on the set of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.
