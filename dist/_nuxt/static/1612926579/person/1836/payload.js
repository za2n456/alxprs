Most of the series takes place in Moz's flat and revolves around the eclectic array of characters who visit Moz to buy cannabis, socialise or both.\n\nThe closing theme is \"Song of the Oss\" from the album Nuada: Music Inspired By the Film the Wicker Man composed by British band Candidate. The series also features a number of tracks by Californian hip hop group Ugly Duckling.\n\nIt was broadcast on BBC Three in the UK, on entertainment channel 3e in Ireland and on ABC2 in Australia.\n\nFirst broadcast in 2005, seven series have been shown; the most recent ended on 30 June 2011.\n\nAfter the seventh series aired, Ideal was cancelled by the BBC. Following the announcement, writer and creator Graham Duff wrote to fans: \"As some of you may have heard, the BBC have decided against commissioning an 8th series of Ideal. The reason given was that the new channel controller wanted to make a clean sweep. It is a source of both pride and frustration that, at the point of cancellation, Ideal was attracting its biggest ever audiences, its highest profile guest stars and its best ever reviews.
