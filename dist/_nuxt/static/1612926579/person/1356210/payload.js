She was offered representation by all the agents that she met. Within three months of being in Hollywood, Millie was offered the role of young Alice in ABC's Once Upon a Time in Wonderland. In November 2013, after just one self-taped audition, and without meeting the producers\u002Fdirectors, Millie was offered the role of Madison O'Donnell in BBC America's show, \"Intruders.\"",birthday:"2004-02-19",deathday:a,gender:g,homepage:a,id:1356210,imdb_id:F,known_for_department:"Acting",name:"Millie Bobby Brown",place_of_birth:"Marbella, Málaga, Andalusia, Spain",popularity:13.328,profile_path:G,images:{profiles:[{aspect_ratio:.6669505962521295,file_path:G,height:1174,iso_639_1:a,vote_average:5.33,vote_count:H,width:783},{aspect_ratio:z,file_path:"\u002FjHHlBUYkApZrVNHcfNleAbTRyOz.jpg",height:768,iso_639_1:a,vote_average:5.264,vote_count:I,width:512},{aspect_ratio:z,file_path:"\u002FzpEydLEAnAZXJB1gu5sdTzeySjz.jpg",height:450,iso_639_1:a,vote_average:5.246,vote_count:l,width:300},{aspect_ratio:.6663084363245567,file_path:"\u002FvhpE40KN0xPObdl602ypBGic1Xb.jpg",height:1861,iso_639_1:a,vote_average:J,vote_count:K,width:1240},{aspect_ratio:z,file_path:"\u002F8gyTvZxc8Wj4uPYrYMyiby5a1a7.jpg",height:2070,iso_639_1:a,vote_average:J,vote_count:K,width:1380}]},combined_credits:{cast:[{adult:b,backdrop_path:L,genre_ids:[p,i,q],original_language:c,original_title:m,poster_path:M,video:b,vote_average:A,vote_count:N,overview:O,release_date:P,title:m,id:Q,popularity:R,character:m,credit_id:"5a56461b9251417aa9024829",order:d,media_type:e},{overview:"In a time when monsters walk the Earth, humanity’s fight for its future sets Godzilla and Kong on a collision course that will see the two most powerful forces of nature on the planet collide in a spectacular battle for the ages.",release_date:"2021-03-25",adult:b,backdrop_path:"\u002FmGJuQwMq1bEboaVTqQAK4p4zQvC.jpg",title:S,genre_ids:[r,n],original_language:c,original_title:S,poster_path:"\u002F3Iso4hatk3N0RTkQFAk7YFO4GGy.jpg",vote_count:d,video:b,id:399566,vote_average:d,popularity:681.615,character:T,credit_id:"5b154f5dc3a368533000d528",order:g,media_type:e},{id:U,video:b,vote_count:d,vote_average:d,title:s,release_date:f,original_language:c,original_title:s,genre_ids:[],backdrop_path:a,adult:b,overview:V,poster_path:a,popularity:j,character:f,credit_id:"5f20e61dbe55b70036a03d55",order:g,media_type:e},{adult:b,backdrop_path:a,genre_ids:[i],vote_count:d,original_language:c,original_title:W,poster_path:a,id:751587,video:b,vote_average:d,title:W,overview:"After Suzy's former best friend is lost from a drowning accident, Suzy knows something isn't right.
