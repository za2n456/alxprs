He rose to prominence in the 90s due to his acting abilities and charismatic personality. His breakout role came extremely early in his acting career in the Oscar-Nominated classic, the Shawshank Redemption. His role as God in the film was brief but extremely memorable. This role officially gave him \"teen-heartthrob\" status and lead him to be featured on the front page of \"Teens Weekly\" a teen magazine that ran for one month due to low ratings and performance. His fanbase, known as the \"E-Heads\" (comprised mostly of pre-teen girls) was famous for being ravenous and dedicated. At the peak of his career, Heldman had a 10-year stint in federal prison for reasons which are to this day unknown. There has been speculation that it may have had something to do with the disappearance of Heldman's long-time rival Kevin Sullivan. After his decade long inactivity, Heldman was pardoned by President Barack Obama due to Heldman's help finding the location of Osama Bin Laden. After his release, Heldman decided to focus on smaller projects to reconnect with himself. He next worked on the cult classic Back to the Future Retold in which he played three roles and worked as a production designer. Notably, his three characters in the film, alongside his line \"Bang\" have become highly popular in Eastern Europe as representations of birth, life, and death. After working on the film, Heldman devoted his time to writing, directing, editing, and starring in an original trilogy of films. In an interview, Heldman said \"I really want these films to express who I am. My previous work hasn't been me. That was Ethan, teenage prodigy y'know? What about Ethan Heldman the guy y'know?  I want these movies to get at the heart of who I am y'know?\" The three films, the Detective's Son, Driving Insane, and Prayer to the Future, while not huge hits at the box office, were amazingly successful critically. Heldman received special acclaim for portraying every single role in Prayer to the Future. The three films are lovingly referred to as \"the Big Three\" by fans. Keen-eared listeners have spotted Heldman's voice in the film Soul. When brought to his attention on Twitter, Heldman denied the cameo due to wanting to stay out of the limelight. When pressed further, Heldman admitted that the director, Pete Doctor was a fan of Heldman's work and offered him the cameo. Heldman's character in the film was named Edgar as a reference to the protagonist in PttF. Due to this sudden re-appearance, Heldman has once again been brought to the attention of the public's eye. In January of 2021, Heldman signed a 5 picture deal with Back to the Future Retold director Ryan Luetzow. Most recently, fans have brought up the prophecy placed upon Ethan at birth which stated that he shall die on the 31st day of March 2021. When asked for a statement, Heldman said \"we are pursuing options to reverse it or find a loophole. I have a twin brother so maybe he can take my place or something y'know?\". His fans have prepared themselves for the worst-case scenario and moved on to the Kevin Sullivan fanbase, as he was recently discovered in a bunker in Siberia. Ethan's story is one of the loss of innocence and the reclaiming of respect, and if his \"neck snaps at the crack of dawn\" as the prophecy states, then at least he will not be forgotten.",birthday:"2006-03-03",deathday:"2021-03-31",gender:L,homepage:a,id:2827989,imdb_id:a,known_for_department:"Acting",name:"Ethan Heldman",place_of_birth:"San Diego, California.",popularity:1.214,profile_path:a,images:{profiles:[]},combined_credits:{cast:[{adult:b,backdrop_path:a,genre_ids:[],id:M,original_language:c,original_title:v,overview:N,poster_path:a,release_date:j,title:v,video:b,vote_average:e,vote_count:e,popularity:k,character:"William Shroud",credit_id:"5f93b8b36dc5070042a10318",order:h,media_type:d},{id:A,video:l,vote_count:h,vote_average:i,title:r,release_date:B,original_language:c,original_title:r,genre_ids:[C,s],backdrop_path:a,adult:b,overview:D,poster_path:a,popularity:E,character:"Uber Driver",credit_id:"5fb310d43a48c5003c8134f8",order:h,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:m,genre_ids:[g],id:n,original_language:c,original_title:f,overview:o,poster_path:a,release_date:j,title:f,video:b,vote_average:i,vote_count:h,popularity:k,character:"Edgar",credit_id:"5fff3e17594c94003e90049a",order:h,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:m,genre_ids:[g],id:n,original_language:c,original_title:f,overview:o,poster_path:a,release_date:j,title:f,video:b,vote_average:i,vote_count:h,popularity:k,character:"Future Edgar",credit_id:"5fff3e2195acf0003e798bff",order:L,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:m,genre_ids:[g],id:n,original_language:c,original_title:f,overview:o,poster_path:a,release_date:j,title:f,video:b,vote_average:i,vote_count:h,popularity:k,character:"Spoon",credit_id:"5fff3e2e90cf51003d4df973",order:3,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:m,genre_ids:[g],id:n,original_language:c,original_title:f,overview:o,poster_path:a,release_date:j,title:f,video:b,vote_average:i,vote_count:h,popularity:k,character:"Tub",credit_id:"5fff3e3dad59b5003dfc0441",order:4,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:m,genre_ids:[g],id:n,original_language:c,original_title:f,overview:o,poster_path:a,release_date:j,title:f,video:b,vote_average:i,vote_count:h,popularity:k,character:"Old Jim",credit_id:"5fff3e4795acf0004079889b",order:5,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:m,genre_ids:[g],id:n,original_language:c,original_title:f,overview:o,poster_path:a,release_date:j,title:f,video:b,vote_average:i,vote_count:h,popularity:k,character:"Local Store Owner",credit_id:"5fff3e5795acf000407988bb",order:6,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:a,genre_ids:[g,F],id:G,original_language:c,original_title:t,overview:H,poster_path:a,release_date:I,title:t,video:l,vote_average:e,vote_count:e,popularity:q,character:"Terrorist\u002FWink Summers\u002FMan in 50s",credit_id:"5fac28e5d55c3d0042d1a8cd",order:O,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:m,genre_ids:[g],id:n,original_language:c,original_title:f,overview:o,poster_path:a,release_date:j,title:f,video:b,vote_average:i,vote_count:h,popularity:k,character:"Marson Maskin",credit_id:"5fff3e6c42d8a5003f3eec8d",order:O,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:m,genre_ids:[g],id:n,original_language:c,original_title:f,overview:o,poster_path:a,release_date:j,title:f,video:b,vote_average:i,vote_count:h,popularity:k,character:"Little Susie",credit_id:"5fff3e7fdfe31d003e64ef8c",order:8,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:a,genre_ids:[w,g,u],id:x,original_language:c,original_title:p,overview:y,poster_path:a,release_date:z,title:p,video:l,vote_average:e,vote_count:e,popularity:q,character:"Terrorist",credit_id:"5fff3fda223e20003fb0a9a2",order:s,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:a,genre_ids:[w,g,u],id:x,original_language:c,original_title:p,overview:y,poster_path:a,release_date:z,title:p,video:l,vote_average:e,vote_count:e,popularity:q,character:"Guy in 50s Bar",credit_id:"5fff3fe97d5db5003cc9607b",order:19,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:a,genre_ids:[w,g,u],id:x,original_language:c,original_title:p,overview:y,poster_path:a,release_date:z,title:p,video:l,vote_average:e,vote_count:e,popularity:q,character:"Reporter",credit_id:"5fff3ff27d5db5003dc9afc4",order:20,media_type:d},{adult:b,backdrop_path:"\u002Fkf456ZqeC45XTvo6W9pW5clYKfQ.jpg",genre_ids:[10751,16,g,s,10402,14],original_language:c,original_title:P,poster_path:"\u002Fhm58Jw4Lw8OIeECIq5qyPYhAeRJ.jpg",id:508442,video:b,vote_average:8.3,vote_count:4630,overview:"Joe Gardner is a middle school teacher with a love for jazz music.
